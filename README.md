# Merchandise Management Dashboard

This dashboard provides insights and analytics on the inter-branch transfer of stock.

Key features include:

1. Branch Network Connectivity: Monitors the connectivity status between branches and tracks stock transfers. 

2. Stock Movement Analytics: Displays the value and volume of stock being moved between branches. 

3. Carbon Footprint Tracking: Calculates the carbon footprint of each transfer and estimates the number of trees required to offset these emissions.

4. Heatmap Visualization: Offers a heatmap of all stores across the UK to provide a geographic overview of stock transfers.
Below is a screenshot of the dashboard.
